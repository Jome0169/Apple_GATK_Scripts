# Apple Variant Calling Notes


The purpose of this project is to call and utalizie the software GATK from the
broad institue to call variants on a set of highly diverse apple read sets.
This is in an effort to learn more about the apple genome and get a sense of
the genomic diversity of the apple genome.


This github is simple a collection of all the scripts I ran in order, and what
the purpose of each script was. Something useful that you may want to note is
that I utalizied bootstrapping to manufacture a golden snp set from a non model
organism. We did this following the GATK guidlines from the broad. NOTE: this
method is still unverrified by the broad... but everyone does it.

All scripts are written in bash, and hopefully one day this pipeline will be
converted to a modern pipeline language like nextflow or snakemake, but that's
for the future.
